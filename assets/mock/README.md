# Mock Data

The files in the folder represents mock data of the labels and patent collections.  See `labels.json` and `patents.json`.

`patents.json` is taken from Krithika's mock dataset.  See [here](https://github.com/pharmaDB/etl_pipeline/tree/main/testdata).  The key values for the patents may be camelCase, depending on the mock data that Anthony generates.

`labels.json` is generated by this package after generating the data from this pull request version of the `dailymed_data_processor` [here](https://github.com/pharmaDB/dailymed_data_processor/pull/9).  This pull request version of the `dailymed_data_processor` has been rewritten slightly from Krithika's original implementation to actually get all relevant sections and subsections.

`sample_label.json` and `sample_patent.json` are specific docs taken from `labels.json` and `patents.json` collections.

##labels.json##

Regarding `labels.json`, these key value pairs are added by this package:

Notice that for `diff_against_previous_label`, the second entry is `[1,'...','0']`.  Since this is an addition signified by the 1, a third value `'0'` is added to this entry.  `'0'` refers to `additions['0']`.

The scores for the mock data are all the same for now for every additions.

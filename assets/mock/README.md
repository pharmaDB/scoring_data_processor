# Mock Data

The files in the folder represents mock data of the labels and patent collections.  See `labels.json` and `patents.json`.

`patents.json` is taken from Krithika's mock dataset.  See [here](https://github.com/pharmaDB/etl_pipeline/tree/main/testdata).  The key values for the patents may be camelCase, depending on the mock data that Anthony generates.

`labels.json` is generated by this package after generating the data from this pull request version of the `dailymed_data_processor` [here](https://github.com/pharmaDB/dailymed_data_processor/pull/9).  This pull request version of the `dailymed_data_processor` has been rewritten slightly from Krithika's original implementation to actually get all relevant sections and subsections.

`sample_label.json` and `sample_patent.json` are specific docs taken from `labels.json` and `patents.json` collections.

##labels.json##

Regarding `labels.json`, these key value pairs are added by this package:

Note that `indices` refers to the index of the `text` starting with index 0.  `indices` is a list, since two indices may share same expanded_text.

`expanded_context` should read from the start of sentence to the end of sentence for a sentence having an addition.  Start or ends of sentences are determined by line breaks, carriage returns, periods, exclamations, or question marks.

The scores for the mock data are all the same for now for every additions.  The particular patent and claim are in `patent.json`.

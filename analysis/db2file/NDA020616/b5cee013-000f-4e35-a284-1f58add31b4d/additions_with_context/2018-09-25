Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with KADIAN and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (\n5.3\n)].
Do not abruptly discontinue KADIAN [see Warnings and Precautions (\n5.13\n), Drug Abuse and Dependence (\n9.3\n)\n].
Risk Summary\nProlonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (\n5.4\n)].
Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (\n5.4\n)].\n
In published animal studies, morphine administration adversely effected fertility and reproductive endpoints in male rats and prolonged estrus cycle in female rats [\ns\nee Nonclinical Toxicology (\n13\n)\n].
Titrate the dosage of KADIAN slowly in geriatric patients and monitor for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings an\nd Pre\ncautions (\n5.6\n)].
Both dose-normalized Cmax and dose-normalized AUC0-48hr values of morphine after a single dose administration of KADIAN in healthy volunteers are less than those for morphine oral solution or an extended-release tablet formulation (Table 2).
When given once daily to 24 patients with malignancy, KADIAN had a similar Cmax and higher Cmin at steady-state when compared to an extended-release morphine tablets, given twice daily at an equivalent total daily dosage (see Table 2).

The minimum effective concentration varies widely and is influenced by a variety of factors, including the extent of previous opioid use, age and general medical condition.  Effective doses in tolerant patients may be significantly higher than in opioid-na\u00efve patients.\nOnset of analgesia occurs with 5-20 minutes following intramuscular administration of morphine, rising to peak analgesia sixty minutes after a single intramuscular injection.  The duration of analgesia after a single injection is usually three to four hours.  Morphine and similar opioid analgesics rapidly induce tolerance to their effects, so that the duration of analgesia may be shorter following subsequent doses of morphine.  Once patients are started on morphine, the dose required for satisfactory analgesia will rise, with the rate of development of tolerance varying depending on the patient's prior narcotic use, level of pain, degree of anxiety, use of other CNS active drugs, circulatory status, total dose and the inter-dose interval.",

Protein binding is low, about 36%, and muscle tissue binding is reported as 54%.  A blood-brain barrier exists, and when morphine is introduced outside of the CNS (e.g., intravenously), plasma concentrations of morphine remain higher than the corresponding CSF morphine levels.\nAverage peak morphine plasma levels of 67.4 \u00b1 22.5 ng/mL were noted around 5 to 30 minutes following intramuscular injection of 10 mg morphine sulfate from a prefilled syringe.  \nMorphine has a total plasma clearance which ranges from 0.9 to 1.2 L/kg/h (liters/kilogram/hour) in postoperative patients, but shows considerable interindividual variation.  The major pathway of clearance is hepatic glucuronidation to morphine -3-glucuronide, which is pharmacologically inactive.  The major excretion path of the conjugate is through the kidneys, with about 10% in the feces.  Morphine is also eliminated by the kidneys, 2 to 12% being excreted unchanged in the urine.  Terminal half-life is commonly reported to vary from 1.5 to 4.5 hours, although the longer half-lives were obtained when morphine levels were monitored over protracted periods with very sensitive radioimmunoassay methods.  The accepted elimination half-life in normal subjects is 1.5 to 2 hours.",

In addition, parenteral morphine may reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions resulting in prolonged labor. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Closely observe neonates whose mothers received opioid analgesics during labor for signs of respiratory depression."

                    "Morphine concentrations are not predictive of analgesic response, especially in patients previously treated with opioids.  The minimum effective concentration varies widely and is influenced by a variety of factors, including the extent of previous opioid use, age and general medical condition.  Effective doses in tolerant patients may be significantly higher than in opioid-na\u00efve patients.\nOnset of analgesia occurs with 5-20 minutes following intramuscular administration of morphine, rising to peak analgesia sixty minutes after a single intramuscular injection.  The duration of analgesia after a single injection is usually three to four hours.  Morphine and similar opioid analgesics rapidly induce tolerance to their effects, so that the duration of analgesia may be shorter following subsequent doses of morphine.  Once patients are started on morphine, the dose required for satisfactory analgesia will rise, with the rate of development of tolerance varying depending on the patient's prior narcotic use, level of pain, degree of anxiety, use of other CNS active drugs, circulatory status, total dose and the inter-dose interval."

                    "Morphine has an apparent volume of distribution ranging from 1.0 to 4.7 L/kg after intravenous dosage.  Protein binding is low, about 36%, and muscle tissue binding is reported as 54%.  A blood-brain barrier exists, and when morphine is introduced outside of the CNS (e.g., intravenously), plasma concentrations of morphine remain higher than the corresponding CSF morphine levels.\nAverage peak morphine plasma levels of 67.4 \u00b1 22.5 ng/mL were noted around 5 to 30 minutes following intramuscular injection of 10 mg morphine sulfate from a prefilled syringe.  \nMorphine has a total plasma clearance which ranges from 0.9 to 1.2 L/kg/h (liters/kilogram/hour) in postoperative patients, but shows considerable interindividual variation.  The major pathway of clearance is hepatic glucuronidation to morphine -3-glucuronide, which is pharmacologically inactive.  The major excretion path of the conjugate is through the kidneys, with about 10% in the feces.  Morphine is also eliminated by the kidneys, 2 to 12% being excreted unchanged in the urine.  Terminal half-life is commonly reported to vary from 1.5 to 4.5 hours, although the longer half-lives were obtained when morphine levels were monitored over protracted periods with very sensitive radioimmunoassay methods.  The accepted elimination half-life in normal subjects is 1.5 to 2 hours."
